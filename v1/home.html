            <h3>A little About Me</h3>
            <p>
                Hi, My name is Charles Tucker. I am currently a student at Cornell 
                University finishing out my final Semester. I am studying Computer
                Science in the Engineering College, and I am on the Cornell 
                Wrestling Team. This website is my first attempt of making a 
                website from scratch that is not only informative but also visually
                appealing. At the start of this project I do not know how to make
                "things look good". Hopefully at each progression of the website
                it will look better. I am not nor do I claim to be a master designer,
                but I can make the promise I will try my very best. Nevertheless, 
                please feel free to take a look around.
            </p>
