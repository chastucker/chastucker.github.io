        <h1>Welcome to the Site!</h1>
        <p>This is the First Version and my first attempt making a website from 
            scratch</p>
        <h3>A little About Me</h3>
        <p>
            Hi, My name is Charles Tucker. I am currently a student at Cornell 
            University finishing out my final Semester. I am studying Computer
            Science in the Engineering College and I am on the Cornell 
            Wrestling Team. This website is my first attempt of making a 
            website from scratch that is not only informative but also visually
             appealing. At the start of this project I do not know how to make
            "things look good". Hopefully at each progression of the website
            it will look better, however I can not make any promises. I can 
            only make the promise that I will try my very best. Nevertheless, 
            please feel free to take a look around.
        </p>
