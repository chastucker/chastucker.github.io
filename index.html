                Hi, my name is Charles Tucker. I am currently a student at Cornell
                University finishing out my final Semester. I am studying Computer
                Science in the Engineering College, and I am on the Cornell
                wrestling team. This is my first attempt of making a
                website from scratch that is not only informative but also visually
                appealing. At the start of this project I do not know how to make
                "things look good". Hopefully at each progression of the website
                it will look better. I am not nor do I claim to be a master designer,
                but I can make the promise that I will try my very best. Nevertheless,
                please feel free to take a look around.
            </p>
