            <p>
                Hi, my name is Charles Tucker. I am currently a student at Cornell University finishing out my final Semester. I am studying Computer Science in the Engineering College, and I am on the Cornell wrestling team. I am currently looking for full time employment
                as a Software Engineer. This is my first attempt of making a website from scratch that is not only informative but also somewhat appealing. This is currently a single page, but I am in the process of making this a multiple page website
                with really cool styling. Thank you for visiting please continue to read to learn more about me.

        <h4>My Journey</h4>
        <p>
            I started wrestling when I was 5 years old at a Worcester Academy all sports Summer Camp. At this camp we played all different types of sports everyday. One sport that stood out to me was wrestling. I talked about it non stop to my parent so they found
            me a place to start wrestling. After this summer camp I started wrestling at the local rec program. It was K-8 and we wrestled in the elementary school gym. After my first year of wrestling I started going to this new club called doughboys
            wrestling club. Currently it is a powerhouse new England wrestling club. When I joined the club it had about 15 kids and it was run out of the Lowell Boys and Girls club.</p>

        <p> Up through middle school I wrestled for a couple of club programs. Some include Doughboy Wrestling club (Lowell MA), All American Wrestling Club (Latrobe PA), Snakepit Wrestling Club (Lawrence MA). In middle school at Worcester Academy (where
            my journey began), I started wrestling in varsity team practices with another middle school student with a mature knowledge of the sport (my sixth grade year). The following year (my seventh grade year), I wrestled with the varsity team again
            and started wrestling in some of the varsity matches at the lowest weight. My last year in middle school, I wrestled in most varsity regular season tournaments and matches. While I was wrestling for the Worcester Academy varsity team, I was
            also competing in national club duals and some national club tournaments. </p>
