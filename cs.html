            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
                It all started when I got to Cornell University. I wanted to be an Engineer like the rest of my family:
                Mom, Biomedical Engineer; sister, Biomedical Engineer; Dad, Mechanical Engineer. So my first semester at
                school, I took some of the general engineering requirements and an intoduction to material science
                engineering class. Why did I take the matsci class? Well because I thought I was going to be a material
                science major ultra genuis. Like come on people. How cool would it be to study awesome materials and
                learn about elements? I thought it was going to be awesome. Dissapering Spoon awesome (this is a book).
                The possibilities of my fatasy world with this degree seemed endless. One so possibility included
                finding a new element, like Tony Stark, and inventing the actual iron man suit. I could then fly around
                the world and be a superhero. That would be insanly awesome. But as that class progressed, so did my
                interest in the feild of material science. How did I know you may ask. Well lets see. The girl I sat
                next to everyday was excited to go to this class, and every week she got more and more excited to learn
                about a semiconductor and a solar panel. My friend and teamate Jonathan and I did not feel the same.
                Coupled with morning lifts and some tough classes before this one, we couldn't hang. We started doing
                the sleep-fall-but-I'm-trying-really-hard-not-to-fall-alseep-in-class-game. Even with an awesome
                proffessor, the material didn't spark anything deep within my engineering bones. It was time to destroy
                all the matsci major dreams of becoming the next ironman and saving the world. It was time to find
                another path. Beaten, broken, and internally upset for giving up of a fantasy dream, I knew I was not
                desdined to become a material sciecnce engineer.

                All of my classes that semester did not really spark anything. So I had to reevaluate. This reevaluation
                led me to the idea of "mabey computer science... but a soft maybe". Then comes the next semester.
                Semester two in my wild unconventional ride of college: Introduction to Computing Using Python. I walk
                into class with my trusty friend Jonathan. (To be continued...)
