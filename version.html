            Why am I doing this
        </h3>
        <p>
            I chose to show the differnt versions of the website for two reasons. The first reason is for anyone
            inspiring to make a static website like this. They can see the progess I made whether it be visually,
            content wise, or organization wise. That you can learn how to do this and it apparently is not that hard.
            The second reason is for myself. I do not want to repeat mistakes that I have made in the past and having a
            record of the past a few clicks away is very handy. The third reason (I lied with just two reasons I'm
            #sorryNotSorry) is also for myself. I like to see the progress I made between jumps of learning. It will
            inspire me to keep pushing and learn more in the tough times.

            Below are my explanations of the versions including the current one.
        </p>

        <div id="about-v1">
            <h3>
                <a href="v1/home.html">Version 1</a>
            </h3>
            <p>
                In this version I had just recently started to remember how to write HTML and CSS code. This version
                does not contain any CSS code or javascript. This version also contains placeholder text because I didnt
                know what to say and I wanted to push make sure it actually works. Proir to writting this I also watch
                an hour long HTML crash course video that went over some basics. Maybe in a future version I will post
                some of these videos.
            </p>

        <div id="about-v2">
            <h3>
                Version 2
            </h3>
            <p>
                In this version of the website, I added some content about myself. I also watched another crash course
                video. This time it was about CSS. Since I am not a designer, nor do I aspire to be one now, I tried to
                crudly make the website look better. As for the HTML, I added classes and ids to some tags and
                reorganized other tags.
